1) Extracting the columns from data set features. To do this, the naming convention of the columns listed in features.txt was used.
   Specifically, *-std()* and *-mean()* were used as match strings. 33 standard deviation and 56 mean columns were found.
   
2) Merging each data set to one table. The data for each set (training and test) is distributed in multiple files. The data is first
   merged to form a single data set. Specifically:
   For each data set:
 - subject_*, y_*, and the 99 mean and std columns from X_* are joined producing a table of 101 columns. 
 - The activity column values obtained from the y_*.txt are renamed to corresponding activity names listed in activity_labels.txt.
 - Set the column names appropriately - derive them from features.txt.

3) Merging the 2 data sets. Both data sets have the same column names. In theory, they can be joined by any column name as they are non-intersecting.
   In other words, the stack vertically, one below the other.

4) Create a new table with activity, subject and average of each activity for the particular activity/subject combination.
